    <p>
      FantasyDJ is a mobile application that allows users to team up and create playlists to compete each week. Using a
      user's Spotify account, playlists are scored based on plays worldwide.

    <p>
      To start a league, find the "Create New League" button on the leagues home page. Give your league a title and choose an opponent. From there, you can pick a song that you think will increase in popularity over the coming week. You and your opponent will alternate to choose three songs each. Each league lasts a week, and whoever has a higher cumulative score at the end wins.
