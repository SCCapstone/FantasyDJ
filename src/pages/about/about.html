    <ion-card-title> Welcome to FantasyDJ!</ion-card-title>

    <p>
      FantasyDJ is a mobile application that allows users to team up and create
      playlists to compete each week, much like fantasy football. Utilizing a
      user's Spotify account, playlists are scored based upon plays worldwide.

    <ion-card-title>Learning to play is simple!</ion-card-title>

    <p>
      All you have to do is find the "create a league" button on the home tab
      and add another player. From there, you can pick a song that you think
      will become even more popular in the coming week and add it to your
      playlist. After this, your opponent will be allowed to add a song, and
      you will go back and forth.
