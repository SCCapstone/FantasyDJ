### How to use FantasyDJ

* Requirements: You will need a spotify account, either premium or free license will work. 

* Starting out: After signing in you will land on the league page, which shows you the current leagues that you are in. As of now, you aren't in any, but that's an easy fix! Find the button that says "Create New League" and give it a click. After this you will be on the league creation page, with the parameters of a league name and the name of an opponent which can be one of your friends spotify ID's. Creating a league will send a push notification to your opponent, which will invite him to join the game. The object of FantasyDJ is essentially pick the three songs that you think are going to get more popular over the coming days or weeks. 
* Picking songs: Initially you will choose a song by navigating to the search page and adding it to your playlist. Then wait for your opponent to choose one, and once you both have 3 songs, your brand new league will begin. Over the next few days you will be able to see how you are doing in comparison to your opponent, both in the league page and the analytics page which has a graph of how your songs have been performing popularity wise.
